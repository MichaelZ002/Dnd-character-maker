  ## Description:

  We built a node application which allows users to generate their own **Dungeons & Dragons character** and export the character build sheet as a PDF. The users can name their characters and choose character specs such as class, race, age, height, primary language and spells to build a character sheet.
  The app utilizes the following technologies:
    * Node and express Web server
    * MySQL database with Sequelize
    * Bootstrap 
    * Handlebars
